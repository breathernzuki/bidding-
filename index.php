                            A bidding farm that deals with livestock is a type of agricultural
                        operation where farmers come together to buy and sell different types of animals.
                        These farms often specialize in raising and caring
                        for a specific type of livestock, such as cows, pigs, chickens,
                        or sheep. <br>
                        The bidding process at these farms allows farmers to compete for the
                        animals they want to purchase, driving up the price and ensuring that the
                        animals are sold for a fair market value. The bidding process also ensures that
                        the animals are sold to the farmer who can provide the best care and resources
                        for them.
                        <br>At a bidding farm, the livestock are well-cared for and are subject to regular
                        health checks to ensure their well-being. These farms play an important role in the agriculture
                        industry, helping farmers to build their herds and supplying the market with high-quality,
                        healthy animals..
